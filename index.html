        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <div class="info fade-in-text">
            <p>Lollipops.  My favorite candy.  I love lollipops so much that my name is Pransh Dalalipop.  My future career goal is to be a software engineer.  I have been interested in programming and computer science since I WAS 10!!  My main plans to achieve these goals are to build lots of projects related to the specific niche of computer science I want to work in, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  I also want to be able to make an impact in my community with these skills.  This has been my goal for a really long time and the reason I have this goal is because of my dad.  My dad is the one that introduced me to computer and programming.  Ever since that, I was instantly hooked on to this and it quickly became a hobby.</p>
